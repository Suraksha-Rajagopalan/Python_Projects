# Python_Projects
Here are some of the python projects which I have completed successfully. These are fun python based projects.

<h2>1. Automate Email Sending</h2>
<h4> ðŸ¤”Service Provider </h4>
In that moment we surely realized that sending, receiving and storing Emails requires the use of a Service Provider. Among these the most common are certainly Google Mail, Microsoft Outlook and Apple iTunes.

It is therefore inevitable to talk about the 3 famous protocols that characterise Email Service Providers:

<p>i. SMTP: is the protocol used for sending emails. Its acronym stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. This is what weâ€™re going to use in this article.</p>
<p>ii. IMAP and POP, on the other hand, are the other two popular protocols that are used respectively to read and download Emails from/in our Client.</p>

<h4>  ðŸ§ The Flow</h4>
Flow of Algorithm:
<p>i. With Python we will instantiate an encrypted connection (STARTTLS) with our Service Provider.</p>
<p>ii. After receiving our Email, our Service Provider (the Sender Server) will send it through SMTP to the Recipient Service Provider (the Recipient Server).</p>
<p>iii. The Recipientâ€™s Server can be used by the Recipientâ€™s Client to read the Email via IMAP or POP.</p>

<h4>  ðŸ“§SMTP Library</h4>
The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon. For details of SMTP and ESMTP operation, consult RFC 821 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and RFC 1869 (SMTP Service Extensions).
